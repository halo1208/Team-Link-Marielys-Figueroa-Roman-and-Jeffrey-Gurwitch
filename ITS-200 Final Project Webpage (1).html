		<p>Music is constantly changing and will continue to change as the years go by. However, there will always be two 
		things that remain constant; a song will always need a singer and instruments to play in sync. The use of instruments 
		dates back to thousands of years ago; it's amazing to see how much things have changed since then! While sound is a 
		big part of music; it is not the main part. Music is used to invoke emotion in the listener, it all depends on the 
		composer's intent. <em>Do they want to make the listerners sad, happy, mad, etc.?</em> If the composer fails to 
		invoke emotion, it will lose fans and listeners. Main people today listen to music to hear and feel the emotion
		behind the music and the lyrics of artists' songs.</p>

 <h3> The Best of the '80s </h3>
 <!--Paragraph tage is used to ad large amounts of information, i.e. paragraphs-->
 <p> The 1980s were a time when many of the best singers of all time emerged or became popular. While music became a big part
 of American culture, only a select few musicians, singers, and bands stuck out from the rest. This decade was mostly known for 
 its indie and rock music and even popularized the genre. The '80s created a new wave of music, and disco was left behind and was 
 replaced. Indie and rock music is still widely popular today, especially with the younger generations such as Gen Z.</p>

<p> The 1990s were when things began to pick up in the realm of music. While indie and rock music was still popular during
 this time, three other genres started to become even more popular. Hip Hop, grunge, and R&B became the new fad. During this 
 time, music started to evolve into something completely new and modern. Another thing that became popular during this decade were 
 <em> one hit wonders</em>. Their music would enter the chart and then slowly climb off and were never seen again. One-hit wonders
 still happen even today, but they are not as often as they were back then.</p>

 <p> The 2000s were the beginning of a whole new century, which meant more modern music; that is still listened to today. Many of
 the singers and bands from this decade are still relatively popular or are still creating music to this day. This was when 
 popular singers today started their careers in the music industry. Many popular songs of today come from the 2000s and the 2010s. Iconic 
 songs like <em>Katy Perry's</em> "Hot n Cold" and <em>Lady Gaga's</em> "Poker Face"  were made during this decade. Today, many people grew up with this 
 type of music and choose to stick with it.</p>

<h3> The Popularization of Hip Hop</h3>
<!--<p> tag is used here for large amounts of information-->
<p>While in the decades prior, hip hop was a widely heard genre of music; it didn't become highly popularized until the 2010s. Hip-hop
soon surpassed many of the other genres of music like rock and pop pretty quickly. Many new artists were able to take off and create
 highly successful music in the industry due to the popularity of hip-hop. While hip hop was the decade's genre, that doesn't mean
other songs from different genres were not created. Rock, pop, and electronic music were still fairly popular during this decade and even
made it high on chart ratings. </p>
